# Immune assay performance performance

## Description
This repository in python3 contains scripts to investigate the role of two factors, ambient shipment temperature and turn-around time (TAT), on immune assay performance, as measured in mean spot count for anti-CD3 positive control.

## Usage

1. Data preprocessing and joining with create_df_01.py

   User provides the file names in < >


```
